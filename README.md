A second brain for guitar effects information I always look up.

## PCBs and Kits
Here are places that sell PCBs and kits that I like to purchase from (alphabetically):
1. [AionFX](https://www.aionfx.com)
2. [DeadEnd FX](https://www.deadendfx.com/)
3. [Effects Layouts](https://www.effectslayouts.com)
4. [FuzzDog](https://shop.pedalparts.co.uk/)
5. [PedalPCB](https://www.pedalpcb.com)
6. [Mas Effects](https://mas-effects.com/)
7. [Small Bear Electronics](https://smallbear-electronics.mybigcommerce.com/)

For the first time builder, I'd suggest the [Ultimmate Beginner Pedal Kit](https://shop.mas-effects.com/products/ultimate-beginner-pedal-kit) from Mas Effects as it has everything (other than soldering iron) to get you from zero to pedal.

## Components
When it comes to purchasing components you can start a holy war. So, I'm just going to go with the places I typically use and what I get from each of them.
1. [Tayda Electronics](https://www.taydaelectronics.com) - passive components (resistors, potentiometers, etc.), enclosures, ocassionally ICs
2. [Mouser](https://wwww.mouser.com) - capacitors, ICs, ocassionally resistors or other passive components, audio jacks, and dc jacs
3. [Love My Switches](https://lovemyswitches.com/) - knobs, enclosures
4. [Stomp Box Parts](https://stompboxparts.com/) - rare diodes, footswitches, ocassionally audio jacks, knobs, enclosures
5. [AionFX](https://www.aionfx.com) - J201 (smd on an adapter for through hole), other specific items related to AionFX builds
6. [Small Bear Electronics](https://smallbear-electronics.mybigcommerce.com/) - wire, pcbs, hard to find ICs or transistors

If you're wondering about quality components, I'll first state that I haven't had an issue with anything I've bought from Tayda or Mouser or anywhere else; but, I generally try to keep to certain brands.

### Resistors
1/4W 1% metal film resistors are what I default to on everything I build (even ones that ask for 1/8W). The Royal Oak ones from Tayda are actually very nice and have thick leads. KAO Speer and Yageo from Mouser are also both good. I'd lean towards buying in bulk as they get cheaper and it lets you build up an inventory. Generally, I buy either 100 or 200 every time I do a purchase of resistors as it strikes a good balance.

### Capacitors
There are a few different types of through-hole capacitors (MLCC, film, tantalum, and electrolytic) that you'll find yourself using in pedal kits and when building them. I'll steal this liberally from [AionFX](https://aionfx.com/resources/parts-sourcing-where-to-buy-what/), as his guide for capacitors is pretty spot on for what to purchase when it comes to them. I generally find that Mouser (in the USA) has really good prices for them -- but you can also find the name brands (WIMA, Panasonic, etc.) at Tayda now as well.

#### MLCC
Use these for the pF values and anything less than 1nF. You want to try and stick to `C0G` and `NP0` as they are the highest quality and the lowest tolerance in capacitance values. `Z5U`, `X5R` and `X7R` drift more with temperature and voltage. You can find these at both Mouser and Tayda. AionFX recommends the TDK FG28 series, so you can't really go wrong with them. I've used all types and haven't noticed much difference, but I do use TDK FG28 if at all possible.

#### Film
Use these for 1nF through until 2.2uF. Again, WIMA and Kemet PHE426 series are the ones you'll want to look for when it comes to high quality. They also are pretty reasonable when you purchase them in bulk. Again, I've used these and generic ones from Mouser and haven't seen much difference but I really do love the bright red WIMA caps.

#### Tantalum
Not too many effects use these, but you'll see them on occassion. Get them from Tayda.

#### Electrolytic
Use these from about 1uF upwards. You can tell when you need to use them on a schematic diagram or PCB because these will be the circular and have a positive and negative terminal clearly marked. You can't go wrong with Panasonic, Nichicon, Rubycon, or Lelon. I typically go with Panasonic or Nichicon but have used ones from Tayda with no issues. Again, if you buy in bulk from Mouser, the pricing is not too bad. Most boards also go with some standardized diameter sizing on electrolytics:

- 1uF–47uF: 5mm
- 100uF–220uF: 6.3mm

### Potentiometers
Tayda and Stomp Box Parts both have wonderful potentiometers. I tend to like Stomp Box Parts' Cusack brand just a shade more than the Alpha or Tayda branded potentiometers but in most my builds I'll just use the Alpha or Tayda ones as the difference is basically imperveciable. If you get the 16mm Tayda potentiometers, make sure you get the 6.35mm diameter shafts. I also generally shy away from splined and d-shafts.

### Diodes
Tayda for basically everything when it comes to diodes. If you're looking for Germanium or Russian ones, Stomp Box Parts is really good or troll eBay, but be careful, as there are some shady sellers.

### Transistors
Mouser or Tayda for them. I haven't gotten a bad one from either. Mouser is _probably_ a little safer, and, again, the more you buy the cheaper they are. If you're cost concious, check both but I've found good deals on transistors at Mouser compared to Tayda. If you're looking for Germanium or Soviet spec transistors -- eBay has a few trust worthy sellers or you can try Stomp Box Parts

### ICs
For anything in production, Tayda or Mouser, after than take a look at Stomp Box Parts or Small Bear Electronics.
